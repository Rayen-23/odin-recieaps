    <h2>Description : </h2>
    <p>Every once in a while, I’ll ask my followers what they might want to see in an upcoming video, which is where the idea for these corn ribs came from. So, please join me in thanking “dude fella” for inspiring this video, which involves a game-changing technique for cutting corn on the cob so we can eat it like a rack of ribs. There’s only one catch: If you don’t know what you’re doing, you can seriously injure yourself.</p>
    <p>Some would argue this method is so amazing and makes eating corn on the cob so pleasurable, that losing a fingertip is a fair trade — but if you follow my instructions, you and your fingers shouldn’t be in any danger. As long as your body parts are always above the blade of the knife, no harm will come to you. Also, take your time. Even if you cut really slowly, this only takes a few minutes per ear, which is much faster than a trip to the ER.</p>
    <p> Once cut, you can season and cook your corn ribs any way you want. But no matter which way you go, this is unlike any other “on the cob” experience you’ve ever had. Since we’re just dealing with a quarter of a cob, our teeth can reach all the way around the “bone,” which means easily biting off every single kernel. Trust me, you will never eat fresh corn any other way, which is why I really do hope you give this a try soon. Enjoy! </p>
    <h2>Ingrediants : </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir together salt, chili powder, smoked paprika, black pepper, cumin, garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne in a small bowl; set aside. </li>
        <li>Using a sharp knife, trim off both ends of each ear of corn to expose the cob. Stand cob on end, and carefully cut corn in half down the exact center of the cob, rocking the knife while applying downward pressure from the top. Stand each cob half on end, and cut into quarters using the same method. Transfer to a large mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Drizzle oil over corn; sprinkle on about 2/3 of spice mixture. Toss well, being sure to smear spices and oil evenly over each rib.</li>
        <li>Ribs can now be finished on a charcoal grill, until hot and well browned.</li>
        <li>To finish indoors, preheat the oven’s broiler and set a rack 7 to 8 inches from the heating element. Line a baking pan with foil. </li>
        <li>Arrange corn ribs on the prepared pan with the maximum number of kernels facing up, toward the heat. Extra foil can be placed on the pan to prop up ribs into the right position. Once arranged, sprinkle with more spice mixture if so desired.</li>
        <li>Broil on High until corn starts to brown in spots, about 7 minutes. Remove and rearrange ribs as needed, so that areas of kernels that are not yet browned are facing up toward the heat, and continue to broil until corn is golden-brown with some charred spots, 7 to 8 minutes more. </li>
        <li>Remove and brush with melted butter; season to taste with remaining spice mixture.</li>
    </ol>
