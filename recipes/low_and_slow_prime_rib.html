    <h2>Description : </h2>
    <p>The simplest, most fail-safe version for cooking a Prime Rib - boneless or bone-in. If there are ribs, they can be removed and made into a Prime Rib Gravy which I have done here.</p>
    <p>Low and Slow Prime Rib â€“ Sorry, Method X, But We Had a Great Run</p>
    <p>We all love the conveniences of modern technology, especially when it comes to kitchen equipment, and appliances, but every once in a while, by making things better, they make something worse. A perfect example would be the fan inside my oven that cools it down after it's turned off. It's a fine feature, but highly problematic when it comes to our critically acclaimed "Method X" Prime Rib technique.</p>
    <h2>Ingrediants :</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Place beef on a pan, and rub with salt. Place meat on a rack or twisted foil so air can circulate under roast, and transfer to the fridge for 24 to 48 hours.</li>
        <li>Remove from the refrigerator and let it rest for a few hours to come to room temperature (optional).</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Transfer roast into a roasting pan, preferably on a rack.</li>
        <li>Mix butter with coarse salt, pepper, and cayenne in a small bowl and spread onto the sides and top of the roast. Then add more salt to the top. Pour water into the bottom of the pan.</li>
        <li>Roast in the preheated oven until internal temperature is 115 to 120 degrees F (46 to 48 degrees C), about 1 hour and 20 minutes (about 20 minutes per pound). Remove from the oven, cover with foil and let rest for at least 20 minutes before serving.</li>
        <li>Drippings from the pan can be deglazed with broth or water, and served alongside meat.</li>
    </ul>
